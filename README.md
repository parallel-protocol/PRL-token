- [Deploy](./deploy) folder contains hardhat deployment scripts.
- [Deployments](./deployments) folder contains info of contracts deployed per network.
- [Docs](./docs) folder contains all documentation related to contracts.
- [Script](./scripts) folder contains Foundry scripts to interact with onchain contracts.
- [Test](./test) folder contains all tests related to the contracts with mocks and settings.

## Contracts Overview

The repository contains 3 types of contract:

- The [`PRL`]('./contracts/principal/PRL.sol) token contract that inherit of Openzeppelin ERC20 and ERC20Permit standards.
- The Migrations contracts handled by the [`PrincipalMigrationContract`]('./contracts/principal/PrincipalMigrationContract.sol) and [`PeripheralMigrationContract`]('./contracts/peripheral/PeripheralMigrationContract.sol) contracts that leveraging on [LayerZero's OApp standard](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/home/protocol/contract-standards#oapp) for migrating Mimo from anychain to PRL on anychain.
- The Bridging of PRL, handled by the [`LockBox`]('./contracts/principal/LockBox.sol) and [`PeripheralPRL`]('./contracts/peripheral/PeripheralPRL.sol) contracts that leveraging on fork of [LayerZero's OFT standard](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/home/protocol/contract-standards#oft) for allow PRL to be omnichain.

See the [documentation](./docs/README.md) for more details.

## Getting Started

### Foundry

Foundry is used for testing and scripting. To
[Install foundry follow the instructions.](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

### Install js dependencies

```bash
bun i
```

### Fill the `.env` file with your data

The Foundry script relies solely on the PRIVATE_KEY. The MNEMONIC is used on the Hardhat side and will override the PRIVATE_KEY if it is defined.

```bash
MNEMONIC=
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=
```

### Compile contracts

```bash
bun run compile
```

### Run tests

```bash
bun run test
```

### Run Coverage

```bash
bun run test:coverage:report
```

You will find other useful commands in the [package.json](./package.json) file.
